 # Office 2.0
 
 Office 2.0 is a start-up project with one main goal: to **improve employees' life and companys' productivity**. To do this, data are collected using a network of beacons that help tracking the workers' actions.

Completely privacy-respectful, our concept foresees both a smartphone and a web application: the first one tracks the workers' positions and saves them in a database, the second one provides the employers with general anonymous statistic data and the employees with a history of their movements. Further functionalities can easily be improved, such as AI data interpretation, or productivity-based rewards for workers, because *a happy worker is a good worker!*
